## What is this?

This is a repo for those who work with **Node.js** and **Docker**.

The propose of it is to cover all the needs since you start writing your first
file, to your rolling-update deployment.

As so, there are four things you need to know about this:
* `node.docker` Launcher - is a command-line tool which is a nice candidate to
  replace all your `node` calls, for a containerized one.
* `cusspvz/node:onbuild` docker image - Docker image with `ONBUILD` statements
  for helping you to deploy small, enhanced and *npm* standardized projects.
* `cusspvz/node:development` docker image - Development image for CI Runners
with built-in Docker-in-Docker support, build and versioning control tools.
* `cusspvz/node:latest` docker image - Docker Image based on Alpine Linux, this
  is the base that is **empowering** the super-heroes above.
