EUPL (c) the European Community 2007


This European Union Public Licence (the "EUPL") applies to the Work or Software
(as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use
of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the
extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor
(as defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL.


1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code
and also as Executable Code as the case may be.

* Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the
Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the
Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;
this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country
mentioned in Article 15.

* The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works.

* The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
convenient for people to study and modify.

communicates the Work under the Licence.

Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.

the Software under the terms of the Licence.

renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
available, on-line or off-line, copies of the Work or providing access to
its essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
person.


2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,

the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case

* lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
* sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to
any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the
rights granted on the Work under this Licence.


3. Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in
a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work.


4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners
in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other
applicable limitations thereto.
